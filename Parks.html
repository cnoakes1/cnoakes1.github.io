            <h3>Broad Street Park</h3>
            <p>This is one of the best park to find mushy crab apples in. The surrounding vegetation provides
                ample mushy apples and you could fill a decent sized sock in a few seconds. Great park for a day out and about picking
                fruit for a dinner time pie.

            <h3>Elgin Park</h3>
            <p> Elgin Park is the worst. There is a dog there called Scradly who lives in a shed behind the park.
                He and his dumb little red leash follow me around barking and biting at my achilles tendon, the most 
                vulnerable of all my tendons. He can take his soggy little eyes and jog-off.

            <img class="pintrestimage" src="imageFolder/HamiltonPark.PNG" alt="Google Street View of Hamilton Park, Lindsay ON.">
            <h3>Hamilton Park</h3>
            <p>Oh boy, where to start with Hamilton Park, not only does this park have huge rocks that keep the local 
                rednecks from doing burnouts on the grass, it also has a field with the least amout of broken glass I've seen in a long time.
                This park offers year round fun, with grass in the summer, muddy puddles in the fall, and snow in the winter. If you're lucky 
                you may even get to see the local pack of wild dogs that like to howl in the gravel lot behind the park. A must see attraction.

            <h3>Mayor Flynn Park</h3>
            <p> Mayor Flynn Park is a staple in the underground sledding community. It offers a hill slightly bigger than the ditch by the Kent Street Timhortans.
                Childen line up for hours to shred down this tubular "pow" hill and try to run into each others shins. Do bring earplugs if you're someone who cherishes their eardrums and or sanity.
